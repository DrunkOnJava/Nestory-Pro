## Data Storage

### Local Storage
All your inventory data is stored locally on your device. The App does not transmit your data to external servers.

### iCloud Sync (Optional)
If you enable iCloud sync:
- Your inventory data is synced to your personal iCloud account
- Data is encrypted in transit and at rest by Apple
- Only you can access your iCloud data
- Apple's privacy policy governs iCloud data handling

### Backups
- Manual backups you create are stored where you choose to save them
- Backup files contain your complete inventory data
- You are responsible for the security of exported backup files

## Third-Party Services

### Apple Services
The App uses the following Apple services:
- **iCloud**: For optional data synchronization (governed by Apple's privacy policy)
- **StoreKit**: For in-app purchases (governed by Apple's privacy policy)
- **Vision Framework**: For on-device OCR processing (no data leaves your device)

### No External Analytics
The App does not use any third-party analytics, crash reporting, or advertising services.

## Data Security

- All data processing occurs on your device
- OCR (receipt scanning) is performed locally using Apple's Vision framework
- No data is transmitted to external servers
- iCloud data is protected by Apple's security measures

## Your Rights

You have complete control over your data:
- **Access**: All your data is visible within the App
- **Export**: You can export your data via backup or PDF reports
